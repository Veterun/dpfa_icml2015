## Introduction

This code implement the deep Poisson factor analysis (DPFA), from the 2015 ICML paper with the same title. 
This source code is made publicly available for reproducibility purposes, it is not optimized for speed, 
minimally documented but fully functional.

I didn't try to integrate the codes, so each dataset has a separate file...
